### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for visiting my GitHub page. I'm George, a junior computer engineering undergraduate at The University of Texas at Arlington. Currently working towards some network related certifications and pcb designs, on the way to better establish by domain of knowledge in both of these fields!

most of my side projects are under the "Gregspace" github organization, visit if your curious! (the littly orange icon under my pfp)
