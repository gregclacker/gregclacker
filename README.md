### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
most of my side projects are under the "[Gregspace](https://github.com/Gregification)" github organization, visit if your curious! 

I'm a computer engineering undergraduate at The University of Texas at Arlington.
Currently working towards some network related certifications and pcb designs, on the way to better establish by domain of knowledge in these fields and many others!
